        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A recipe for "Grandma's Yeast Rolls"
            </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/2 cups warm water</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup shortening</li>
                <li>7 cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed</li>
                <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Stir in sugar and salt until
                    you see foam rising. Add 3 cups flour and 3/4 cup shortening; mix with the dough hook until the mixture is the
                    consistency of a thick pancake batter.</li>
                <li>Fill a pot with hot water.</li>
                <li>Remove the mixer bowl and cover it with plastic wrap and a towel. Place the bowl over the pot of hot water, making
                    sure the bottom does not touch the water. Let rise until doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Place the bowl back on your stand mixer and gradually mix in remaining 4 cups flour until dough is smooth and
                    elastic; you may need to add up to 1 additional cup.</li>
                <li>Heavily grease two 9x13-inch pans with shortening.</li>
                <li>Divide dough into 24 balls. Place 12 balls into each of the prepared pans; cover with plastic wrap and a towel.
                    Let rise in a warm area until doubled in size, about 1 hour; balls will start out at about 1 1/2 inches in
                    diameter but will rise and touch the sides of the pans.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush
                    melted butter over top.</li>
            </ol>
