        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

                <li>Bread</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Sliced Cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Grab a small pan, place a spoonful of butter in the pan, and set the heat to medium high.</li>
                <li>Grab the first slice of bread and spread butter on one side, covering it completely.</li>
                <li>Once the butter in the pan is melted, place the bread butter side down into the pan.</li>
                <li>Place the sliced cheese onto the back of the bread in the pan.</li>
                <li>Butter one side of the remaining piece of bread, and place it butter side up ontop of the sliced cheese
                    in the pan.
                </li>
                <li>Check to see if the bread touching the pan is golden-brown; if it is, flip the sandwich.</li>
                <li>Once the last side is golden-brown, remove the sandwich from the pan and turn off the stove.</li>
            </ol>
